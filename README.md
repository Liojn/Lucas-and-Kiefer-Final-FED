# Cards of Chaos
Welcome to Cards of Chaos, an immersive gaming experience where fate is in your hands. Dive into a world of magic and mystery as you embark on a thrilling adventure across three distinct realms. Upon signing in, players draw three cards, each holding the power to transport them to one of three unique worlds: a verdant grassland teeming with life, a foreboding cave filled with ancient secrets, or a dark netherworld haunted by sinister forces.

Once transported, players harness magical abilities, from unleashing fiery jets to wielding their bare fists, to conquer the realm's formidable boss and earn their ticket home. Whether battling a colossal plant guardian in the lush grass world, facing off against a formidable stone golem deep within the cavernous depths, or braving the relentless onslaught of minions in the grim netherworld, every encounter promises excitement and challenge. With Cards of Chaos, adventure awaits at every turnâ€”do you dare to seize it?

## Design Process
Designing Cards of Chaos was a journey fueled by the desire to create an engaging and memorable experience tailored specifically for teenagers around the age of 17. Understanding the target audience was crucial in shaping every aspect of the game, from its overall theme and storyline to the mechanics and user interface. Teenagers at this age seek entertainment that is not only fun and enjoyable but also offers a sense of adventure and excitement. With this in mind, our project aimed to deliver a unique and creative gaming experience that would captivate and immerse players into fantastical worlds filled with magic and mystery.
